# (Initial) Want:

RBGW Strip inside Riser to display print status similar to H2D Bar or Panda Status

# Want:

WS2812B LED Ring to display print status of remote printer; including whether Chamber Light, or Riser Strip are lit

(When Ring Light finished and X1C Moved remotely, probably change Riser LED to just White for supplemental Chamber illumination)

## Another side automation
Make a fix for Chamber Light turning on with power interuption
